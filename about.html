My name is Matthew Wu, and I’m a first-generation college student studying Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, I've always been fascinated 
                    by understanding how things function in the real world. My passion for creative expression and practical problem-solving naturally led me toward engineering—a 
                    field where logic meets creativity. My upbringing emphasized finding a stable career, but equally important to me is pursuing genuine enjoyment and personal fulfillment.
                    Engineering allows me to achieve this balance by creating tangible solutions, exploring new ideas, and connecting meaningfully with others.

                    Outside the classroom, my interests reflect my appreciation for structured competition and creativity. Playing piano and soccer competitively has taught me discipline, 
                    resilience, and adaptability. Additionally, I love building hardware and software projects aimed at solving everyday problems and capturing interesting social interactions. 
                    Sharing my projects online, including both successes and setbacks, has become integral to my process, bridging engineering with real-life experiences. I also enjoy strategic 
                    board games like Risk and Catan, which inspire me to integrate engaging, intuitive problem-solving into future engineering projects.

                    Growing up in Lilburn, a suburb outside Atlanta, provided me stability but also inspired a desire for broader experiences. Participating in a Taiwanese English Program introduced 
                    me to diverse global perspectives, highlighting the value of learning from others. This realization shapes my approach to engineering, emphasizing connection and dialogue. My long-term 
                    goal is to start my own business or platform, allowing me to support my family while doing work I love. To achieve this, I plan to pursue a Delta TechOps internship, join a Vertically 
                    Integrated Projects (VIP) research team, participate in Create-X, and compete in the InVenture Prize before graduating in 2028. By 2026, I aim to secure my first major internship, and by 2029, 
                    I'll either enter graduate school or launch my own venture. Wherever this journey takes me, I'm excited to continue creating, learning, and connecting with others.
