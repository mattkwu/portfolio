                    My name is Matthew Wu, and I’m a first-generation college student currently studying Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. Born and raised in Atlanta, 
                    Georgia, I've always been intrigued by how things operate—not only conceptually but practically, in everyday life. This curiosity, combined with my passion 
                    for creative expression and problem-solving, naturally drew me toward engineering, a field where logic and creativity intersect seamlessly. Coming from a 
                    close-knit family with one sibling, my upbringing emphasized finding a career that provides financial stability, but equally important to me has always been
                    the pursuit of genuine enjoyment and personal fulfillment in my work. Engineering satisfies this dual goal—it offers me the chance to build tangible solutions 
                    while also allowing room for exploration, innovation, and meaningful human connections.

                    Outside the classroom, my interests are diverse yet interconnected, often reflecting my deep appreciation for both structured competition and spontaneous creativity. 
                    I've spent many years playing piano and soccer competitively, which has taught me discipline, resilience, and the importance of balancing precision with improvisation. 
                    Additionally, I love engaging in personal hardware and software projects designed to address real-world issues, from simplifying daily tasks to capturing unique aspects
                    of social interaction. Sharing my projects online, including the setbacks and unexpected turns, has become a rewarding part of my process. It allows me to showcase the
                    genuine human experience behind technological innovation, bridging the gap between engineering and everyday life. I also have a personal passion for board games—titles 
                    like Risk and Catan fascinate me because of their blend of strategy, human psychology, and interaction. My hope is to one day integrate these game-like elements into engineering
                    projects that make problem-solving engaging, intuitive, and fun.

                    My long-term goal is to start my own business or create a platform—perhaps within social media or a related technological space—that allows me to support my family financially 
                    while doing work that genuinely excites me. To achieve this vision, I've laid out several actionable steps for my college years. Securing an internship at Delta's TechOps division
                    is high on my list, as it would offer both practical engineering experience and the opportunity to explore the world. Additionally, I'm eager to participate in Georgia Tech's Vertically 
                    Integrated Projects (VIP), which would provide long-term, hands-on research experience. Before graduating in 2028, my plan includes engaging in the Create-X startup accelerator program 
                    and potentially competing in the InVenture Prize—both programs designed to cultivate entrepreneurial skills and innovative thinking. I've learned the value of presenting my ideas clearly
                    and confidently—an ongoing process I continue to improve by documenting my progress and sharing it through online platforms. By summer 2026, I aim to have secured my first major internship,
                    and by 2029, my goal is either to pursue graduate school or embark directly on launching my own venture. Wherever this path takes me—whether rooted in Atlanta or extending globally—I’m
                    excited to embrace the journey ahead and continue connecting, creating, and growing along the way.
