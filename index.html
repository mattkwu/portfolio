        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a first-year Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech, diving deep into everything from distributed 
            systems to hardware design. I’ve always been curious about how complex systems work—what makes them tick, 
            and how software and hardware come together to create something meaningful. Lately, I’ve been really drawn
            to the idea of sharing what I build, whether it's a cool project, a learning moment, or something I wish 
            someone had explained to me earlier. My goal is to create content that not only shows my engineering journey 
            but also helps others learn and get inspired along the way.
