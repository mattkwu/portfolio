    <h2>Wearable Social Challenge Device</h2>

    <p>
      This wearable device encourages real-world social interaction by assigning tasks and enforcing accountability through a TENS shock system if the task isn't completed. It's a blend of behavioral psychology, engineering, and creative discomfort.
    </p>

    <h3>üß† Project Idea</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to create something that would force me to talk to strangers in person. Motivation alone wasn't enough, so I introduced a consequence: a small electric shock.
    </p>

    <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Progress</h3>
    <p>
      I started by connecting an OLED screen and ESP32. I integrated GPS, task randomization, and a relay-controlled TENS unit. I struggled with miswiring, GPS lag, and duct-taping it all to my wrist, but it worked!
    </p>

    <h3>‚öôÔ∏è ECE Skills Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Analog input from knobs</li>
      <li>I2C for OLED</li>
      <li>UART for GPS</li>
      <li>Relay triggering via GPIO</li>
      <li>Real-time task and countdown control</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üí¨ Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      I shocked myself, literally, but I also learned how to build something physical that challenges behavior. This was one of the most fun and chaotic projects I‚Äôve ever done.
