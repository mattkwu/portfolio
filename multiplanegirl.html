    <h2>Socialize Watch</h2>

    <p>
        When I first came to college, I found myself spending most of my time isolated in my room and gradually avoiding social interaction altogether. 
        I wanted something that would actively remind me to engage with people — but I knew gentle reminders weren’t enough. 
        So I built a wearable device with a little extra “encouragement”: if I skip a task, it shocks me. 
        The goal was to make it practical, personal, and uncomfortable enough to work — so I designed it in the form of a watch.

    <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Project Development</h3>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li><strong>ESP32 Dev Module:</strong> The core microcontroller that powers the device and runs the full task, GPS, and relay control program.</li>
        <li><strong>OLED Display (128x64, I2C, SSD1306):</strong> Displays the welcome message, randomly selected tasks, countdown timers, and GPS-based location data.</li>
        <li><strong>NEO-6M GPS Module with U.FL Antenna:</strong> Continuously provides the device's live location to determine which task set to load.</li>
        <li><strong>Potentiometer (10kΩ):</strong> A twistable knob used to initiate and complete tasks — simple, tactile, and effective input method.</li>
        <li><strong>Relay Module (1-Channel, 5V logic):</strong> Acts as a switch to connect or disconnect the TENS unit based on task completion status.</li>
        <li><strong>TENS 7000 Unit:</strong> Delivers a small electric shock to reinforce task completion accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Lithium Polymer Battery (3.7V, 1000mAh):</strong> Powers the entire wearable device independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Breadboard (Full size):</strong> Prototyping space used to connect all components safely and non-permanently during testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Jumper Wires:</strong> Used to make all necessary electrical connections between ESP32, sensors, relay, and other components.</li>
        <li><strong>Red/Black TENS Wire Cable:</strong> Custom-wired connection from the relay module to the TENS unit for delivering shocks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> ECE Skills Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading analog values from a potentiometer</li>
        <li>Using I2C for OLED and UART for GPS</li>
        <li>Implementing logic-controlled relay switching</li>
        <li>Conditional timing with state-based task control</li>
        <li>Parsing and filtering live GPS coordinates</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This was probably the wildest and most personal project I’ve ever done. I shocked myself on purpose, learned how to debug hardware under pressure, 
        and had fun watching people react when I told them what it does. More importantly, it taught me how to blend behavior science and embedded systems 
        into a real working prototype.
