    <h2>Socialize Watch</h2>

    <p>
        When I first came to college, I found myself spending most of my time isolated in my room and gradually avoiding social interaction altogether. 
        I wanted something that would actively remind me to engage with people — but I knew gentle reminders weren’t enough. 
        So I built a wearable device with a little extra “encouragement”: if I skip a task, it shocks me. 
        The goal was to make it practical, personal, and uncomfortable enough to work — so I designed it in the form of a watch.

    <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Project Development</h3>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li><strong>ESP32 Dev Module:</strong> The core microcontroller that powers the device and runs the full task, GPS, and relay control program.</li>
        <li><strong>OLED Display (128x64, I2C, SSD1306):</strong> Displays the welcome message, randomly selected tasks, countdown timers, and GPS-based location data.</li>
        <li><strong>NEO-6M GPS Module with U.FL Antenna:</strong> Continuously provides the device's live location to determine which task set to load.</li>
        <li><strong>Potentiometer (10kΩ):</strong> A twistable knob used to initiate and complete tasks — simple, tactile, and effective input method.</li>
        <li><strong>Relay Module (1-Channel, 5V logic):</strong> Acts as a switch to connect or disconnect the TENS unit based on task completion status.</li>
        <li><strong>TENS 7000 Unit:</strong> Delivers a small electric shock to reinforce task completion accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Lithium Polymer Battery (3.7V, 1000mAh):</strong> Powers the entire wearable device independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Breadboard (Full size):</strong> Prototyping space used to connect all components safely and non-permanently during testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Jumper Wires:</strong> Used to make all necessary electrical connections between ESP32, sensors, relay, and other components.</li>
        <li><strong>Red/Black TENS Wire Cable:</strong> Custom-wired connection from the relay module to the TENS unit for delivering shocks.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>1. Embedded Systems Programming</h3>
        <hr style="width: 220px; margin: 5px 0 20px 0;">
        <p>
            Using Arduino (C++), you implemented a real-time interaction system that responds to user input via a potentiometer, 
            displays updates on an OLED, reads GPS data through serial communication, and controls a relay to trigger physical feedback. 
            You applied <code>millis()</code>-based non-blocking timers to manage task durations, a fundamental embedded programming technique.

        <h3>2. Relay-Based Actuator Control</h3>
        <hr style="width: 270px; margin: 5px 0 20px 0;">
        <p>
            You successfully integrated a hardware relay with the ESP32 to control a high-voltage device (TENS unit) using low-voltage logic. 
            This involved understanding how to safely isolate and switch circuits using digital outputs. 
            You physically modified commercial hardware and routed it through a programmable switch — showcasing real-world actuator control 
            and circuit-level reasoning.

        <h3>3. GPS Sensor Integration & Location Filtering</h3>
        <hr style="width: 360px; margin: 5px 0 20px 0;">
        <p>
            By interfacing a NEO-6M GPS module with the ESP32, you retrieved real-time coordinates and compared them to preset geofences to adapt behavior. 
            You dynamically filtered task lists based on physical location, demonstrating your ability to combine hardware sensor data 
            with logical control structures in software.

    <h3><i class="fas fa-comment"></i> Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        This was probably the wildest and most personal project I’ve ever done. I shocked myself on purpose, learned how to debug hardware under pressure, 
        and had fun watching people react when I told them what it does. More importantly, it taught me how to blend behavior science and embedded systems 
        into a real working prototype.
