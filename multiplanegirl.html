    <h2>Socialize Watch</h2>

    <p>
        When I first came to college, I found myself spending most of my time isolated in my room and gradually avoiding social interaction altogether. 
        I wanted something that would actively remind me to engage with people — but I knew gentle reminders weren’t enough. 
        So I built a wearable device with a little extra “encouragement”: if I skip a task, it shocks me. 
        The goal was to make it practical, personal, and uncomfortable enough to work — so I designed it in the form of a watch.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wanted to build something that would challenge me to socialize more in person. Traditional reminders didn’t work for me, so I added a physical feedback system: 
        if I ignore a task, the device triggers a shock via a TENS unit. It’s part experiment, part self-growth, and part embedded systems challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
        I started by building a basic OLED + ESP32 interface, then added GPS, knobs, and task randomization. I tested each component in isolation, 
        then integrated them using real-time logic. I even used duct tape for early wearability tests.

    <p>
        This was probably the wildest and most personal project I’ve ever done. I shocked myself on purpose, learned how to debug hardware under pressure, 
        and had fun watching people react when I told them what it does. More importantly, it taught me how to blend behavior science and embedded systems 
        into a real working prototype.
